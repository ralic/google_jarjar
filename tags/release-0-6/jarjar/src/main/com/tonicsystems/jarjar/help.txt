Usage:

  java -jar jarjar.jar [--help]

    Prints this help message.

  java -jar jarjar.jar --rules=file [--verbose] <in-jar> <out-jar>

    Transform the <in-jar> jar file, writing a new jar file to <out-jar>.
    Any existing file named by <out-jar> will be deleted.

    The transformation is defined by a set of rules in the file specified
    by the rules argument. See the manual for format of the rules file.

  java -jar jarjar.jar --find [--level=value] <cp1> [<cp2>] 

    Prints dependencies on classpath <cp2> in classpath <cp1>. If <cp2>
    is omitted, <cp1> is used for both arguments.

    The level argument can be "class" (default) or "jar". The former
    prints dependencies between individual classes, while the latter
    only prints jar->jar dependencies. A "jar" in this context is
    actually any classpath component, which can be a jar file, a zip
    file, or a parent directory (see below).

  java -jar jarjar.jar --strings <cp>

    Dumps all string literals in classpath <cp>. Line numbers will be
    included if the classes have debug information.

Classpath format:

  The classpath argument is a colon or semi-color delimited set
  (depending on platform) of directories, jar files, or zip files. See
  the following page for more details:
